Description: Fit a latent embedding multivariate regression (LEMUR) model to multi-condition
  single-cell data. The model provides a parametric description of single-cell data measured
  with complex experimental designs. The parametric model is used to (1) align conditions, (2) predict
  log fold changes between conditions for all cells, and (3) identify cell neighborhoods with 
  consistent log fold changes. For those neighborhoods, a pseudobulked differential expression test
  is conducted to assess which genes are significantly changed.
