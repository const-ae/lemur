\arguments{
\item{fit}{the \code{lemur_fit} generated by \code{lemur()}}

\item{group_by}{If the \code{independent_matrix} is provided, \code{group_by} defines
how the pseudobulks are formed.}

\item{contrast}{a specification which contrast to fit. This defaults to the
\code{contrast} argument that was used for \code{test_de} and is stored in \code{fit$contrast}.}

\item{selection_procedure}{specify the algorithm that is used to select the
neighborhoods for each gene. Broadly, \code{selection_procedure = "zscore"} is faster
but less precise than \code{selection_procedure = "contrast"}.}

\item{directions}{a string to define the algorithm to select the direction onto
which the cells are projected before searching for the neighborhood.
\code{directions = "random"} produces denser neighborhoods, whereas \code{directions = "contrast"}
has usually more power. \cr
Alternatively, this can also be a matrix with one direction for each gene
(i.e., a matrix of size \code{nrow(fit) * fit$n_embedding}).}

\item{min_neighborhood_size}{the minimum number of cells per neighborhood. Default: \code{50}.}

\item{de_mat}{the matrix with the differential expression values and is only relevant if
\code{selection_procedure = "zscore"} or \code{directions = "random"}. Defaults
to an assay called \code{"DE"} that is produced by \code{lemur::test_de()}.}

\item{test_data}{a \code{SummarizedExperiment} object or a named list of matrices. The
data is used to test if the neighborhood inferred on the training data contain a
reliable significant change. If \code{test_method} is \code{"glmGamPoi"} or \code{"edgeR"} a test
using raw counts is conducted and two matching assays are needed: (1) the continuous
assay (with \code{continuous_assay_name}) is projected onto the LEMUR fit to find the latent
position of each cell and (2) the count assay (\code{count_assay_name}) is used for
forming the pseudobulk. If \code{test_method == "limma"}, only the continuous assay is needed. \cr
The arguments defaults to the test data split of when calling \code{lemur()}.}

\item{test_data_col_data}{additional column data for the \code{test_data} argument.}

\item{test_method}{choice of test for the pseudobulked differential expression.
\href{https://bioconductor.org/packages/glmGamPoi/}{glmGamPoi} and
\href{https://bioconductor.org/packages/edgeR/}{edgeR} work on an count assay.
\href{http://bioconductor.org/packages/limma/}{limma} works on the continuous assay.}

\item{continuous_assay_name, count_assay_name}{the assay or list names of \code{independent_data}.}

\item{size_factor_method}{Set the procedure to calculate the size factor after pseudobulking. This argument
is only relevant if \code{test_method} is \code{"glmGamPoi"} or \code{"edgeR"}. If \code{fit} is subsetted, using a
vector with the sequencing depth per cell ensures reasonable results.
Default: \code{NULL} which means that \code{colSums(assay(fit$test_data, count_assay_name))} is used.}

\item{design, alignment_design}{the design to use for the fit. Default: \code{fit$design}}

\item{add_diff_in_diff}{a boolean to specify if the log-fold change (plus significance) of
the DE in the neighborhood against the DE in the complement of the neighborhood is calculated.
If \code{TRUE}, the result includes three additional columns starting with \code{"did_"} short for
difference-in-difference. Default: \code{TRUE}.}

\item{make_neighborhoods_consistent}{Include cells from outside the neighborhood if they are
at least 10 times in the k-nearest neighbors of the cells inside the neighborhood. Secondly,
remove cells from the neighborhood which are less than 10 times in the k-nearest neighbors of the
other cells in the neighborhood. Default \code{FALSE}}

\item{skip_confounded_neighborhoods}{Sometimes the inferred neighborhoods are not limited to
a single cell state; this becomes problematic if the cells of the conditions compared in the contrast
are unequally distributed between the cell states. Default: \code{FALSE}}

\item{control_parameters}{named list with additional parameters passed to underlying functions.

If an explicit \code{test_data} argument is provided (and it is not equal to \code{fit$test_data}) or if
\code{control_parameter$merge_indices_columns = FALSE}, the function returns separate neighborhood columns
for the test and training data instead of a merged one.}

\item{verbose}{Should the method print information during the fitting. Default: \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
a data frame with one entry per gene
\describe{
\item{\code{name}}{The gene name.}
\item{\code{neighborhood}}{A list column where each element is a vector with the cell names included
in that neighborhood.}
\item{\code{n_cells}}{the number of cells in the neighborhood (\code{lengths(neighborhood)}).}
\item{\code{sel_statistic}}{The statistic that is maximized by the \code{selection_procedure}.}
\item{\code{pval}, \code{adj_pval}, \code{t_statistic}, \code{lfc}}{The p-value, Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p-value (FDR), the
t-statistic, and the log2 fold change of the differential expression test defined by \code{contrast} for the
cells inside the neighborhood (calculated using \code{test_method}). Only present if \code{test_data} is not \code{NULL}.}
\item{\code{did_pval}, \code{did_adj_pval}, \code{did_lfc}}{The measurement if the differential expression of the cells
inside the neighborhood is significantly different from the differential expression of the cells outside
the neighborhood. Only present if \code{add_diff_in_diff = TRUE}.}
